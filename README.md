# NLP-Based Autocorrect System

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Natural Language Processing project that implements an autocorrect system for text input.  
The project focuses on understanding how spelling correction can be approached using basic NLP and probabilistic techniques.

This work is intended as a **learning and practice project**.

---

## Contents
The repository includes:
- A Jupyter notebook implementing the autocorrect pipeline
- Sample text data used for vocabulary and frequency analysis
- Supporting code for generating correction suggestions

---

## Notebook
- `autocorrect_system.ipynb`  
  Implements text preprocessing, word frequency analysis, candidate generation, and correction selection.

---

## Objective
To gain hands-on experience with:
- Text normalization and tokenization
- Edit-distance–based candidate generation
- Probability-based word correction
- End-to-end NLP pipeline design

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- NLTK  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Notes
- This is a learning-oriented implementation, not a production-grade autocorrect engine.
- The approach is kept simple for conceptual clarity.
